Description: Drawing heavy influence from 'blscrapeR', this package scrapes crime data from <https://www.bjs.gov/>. Specifically, it scrapes data from the National Crime Victimization Survey which tracks personal and household crime in the USA. The idea is to utilize the 'tidyverse' methodology to create an efficient work flow when dealing with crime statistics.
